<h2>🔍 Analysis Approach</h2>

<p>
The analysis began with exploratory data analysis to understand the structure,
distribution, and quality of the data.
Customer demographics and product-related variables were examined
to identify high-performing groups and categories.
</p>

<p>
Business-focused analysis was then performed to compare spending behavior
across gender, age groups, subscription status, shipping types,
and product categories.
Special attention was given to understanding repeat customers,
loyal buyers, and the impact of discounts on spending.

<h2>📊 Dashboard Insights</h2>

<p>
The dashboard provides a high-level view of customer behavior using key metrics
such as total customers, average purchase amount, and average review rating.
Category-level analysis shows which product groups contribute the most to revenue,
while age-group analysis highlights the most valuable customer segments.
</p>

<p>
Subscription analysis reveals the proportion of subscribed versus non-subscribed customers,
and shipping analysis helps compare customer spending across delivery options.
Interactive filters allow users to explore patterns by gender, category,
subscription status, and shipping type.
